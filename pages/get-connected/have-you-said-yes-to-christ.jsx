                      Saying ‘Yes’ to Christ means you accept Jesus Christ as
                      your Lord and Savior. It means you have put yourself into
                      a healthy and fulfilling relationship with Christ and it
                      ensures your place in heaven. YOU ARE SAVED!
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="bold">
                      Salvation is a free gift from God. Through Jesus' death
                      and resurrection we are saved from our sin.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
                      Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but
                      have everlasting life. John 3:16 Salvation is offered as a
                      free gift to those who believe in Him. You must believe in
                      His birth, life, death, resurrection, and His deity. It is
                      key to recognize that our salvation is accomplished
                      through the grace of God. The word grace means “undeserved
                      favor.” It means God is offering you something you could
                      never provide for yourself. Forgiveness of sins and
                      eternal life can never be earned by human effort. God’s
                      gift to you is free. You do not have to work for it, just
                      receive it with joy and thankfulness.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="bold">
                      Salvation is received through faith in Jesus Christ.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and
                      believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and
                      shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death
                      into life.John 5:24
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With salvation, not only do you return to the promise of
                      eternal joy and peace with God, but your life today is
                      filled with blessings, seen and unseen while you are
                      positioned to fulfill your divine purpose. When you
                      receive Christ into your heart you become a child of God,
                      and have the privilege of talking to Him in prayer at any
                      time about anything. The Christian life is a personal
                      relationship with God through Jesus Christ. And best of
                      all, it is a relationship that will last for all eternity.

                      If you are ready to accept the gift of salvation you can
                      say aloud this simple prayer, right now, wherever you are…
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      “Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins
                      have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I
                      want to turn away from my past sinful life and turn toward
                      you. Please forgive me of my sins. I believe that your
                      son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from
                      the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to
                      become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart
                      from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to
                      help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my
                      life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.”

                          God did not send Jesus to condemn the world, but to
                          save it. We all have sinful histories we would like to
                          forget. That sinful past can make us feel unworthy of
                          salvation and deserving of condemnation. The Gospel is
                          good news because through Jesus Christ we all have
                          access to the grace of God.{" "}

                          in your trust in God. We get excited about knowing God
                          will provide for our needs. We also learn to be

                      When you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, God
                      cleanses you of your sin and restores you to relationship
                      with Him. But there are some things you need to do in
                      order to grow in this relationship.

                      <span className="bold">Prayer</span>- Develop the habit of
                      praying often. Praise God and thank Him for big and small
                      things. Share with God your doubts, fears, faults, joys

                        Reading and Studying Scripture
                      </span>
                      - Reading the Bible daily is essential for Christian
                      growth. Through Scripture we learn the will of God and
                      gain insight for victorious living.

                    <p>
                      <span className="bold">Worship</span>- Worship is our
                      highest, most intimate expression of our relationship with
                      God. We acknowledge who He is in our lives with reverence,
                      praise, thanksgiving, sacrifice and celebration.

                      <span className="bold">Fellowship of Belivers</span>- When you come into relationship with Christ, He also calls you into fellowship with other believers. Regular attendance at church services and Bible Study is important. You cannot grow as a Christian in isolation. We are a community of believers.

                    <p>
                      <span className="bold">Service</span>- We grow as we serve the Lord and others. God gave each of us spiritual gifts and talents necessary to edify the Body of Christ, the church. We benefit from the service we render while others are benefiting as well.

                      <span className="bold">Fasting</span>- Fasting develops discipline. We can fast or give up anything that the flesh desires, such as food, for a limited specific period of time, which we dedicate to God.
